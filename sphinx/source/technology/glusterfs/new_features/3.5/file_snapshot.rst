File Snapshot
-------------

Provides a mechanism for snapshotting individual files. One of the more anticipated features of the 3.5 release, this precedes the upcoming ability to snapshot entire volumes. The most prevalent use case for this feature will be to snapshot running VMs, allowing for point-in-time capture. This also allows a mechanism to revert VMs to a previous state directly from Gluster, without needing to use external tools.
